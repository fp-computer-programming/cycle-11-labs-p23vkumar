#1. Create a Python file named lab_12-7.py
#2. Create a second Python file named lab_12-7_functions.py
#. In the lab_12-7_functions.py file, create AT LEAST 10 different
#functions (you may copy from earlier assignments). Within the
#functions you write, you must account for the following:
#a. at least one function must use a dictionary (can be as the argument)
#b. you must use at least 3 different lists
#c. you must use a for loop, a while loop, and enumerate
#d. you must use at least 5 built in functions (like lower()).
##e. your functions all must return at the end.
#f. at least 5 of the functions must be over 15 (logical) lines of code in length)
#4. In the lab_12-7.py file, call (print) at least 4 of the functions. You
#may choose any method to do this.


#• Typically, imported files will contain functions and variables
#• They will not execute code (this is done in the main file)
#•Works in the same manner as importing modules
