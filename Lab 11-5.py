#1. Create a Python file named lab_11-5.py
#2. Create a list called day_date that contains the number day for the
#next 5 days, starting with, "2", for today.
#3. Using a tuple, assign the 5 letters from the list to a variable that
#represents each day using a single statement. The variables can be
#something like, thu, fri, mon, tue, wed. Look at the last slide of
#notes for help.
#4. Print each of the variables (thu, fri, mon, tue, wed) to see what
#they equal


#list called day_date that contains the number day for the
