#1. Create a Python file named lab_11-1.py
#2. Create a dictionary called row.
#3. Add key:value pairs to the dictionary for each person in the row,
#where the key is the computer they are sitting at and the value is
#their first name.
#4. Print the dictionary and notice the order the key:value pairs are
#listed in.
#5. Imagine you were out for a day and someone else sat at your
#computer. How would you update the dictionary to reflect this
#change? Add this line after your print statement.


#dicitionary called row having a set of keys and values pertaining to students in the class
row = {'Tanner Langis':2, 'Jack Rydzik':3, 'Preston Lyons':5, 'Vishnu Kumar':7, 'Brian Connolly':8, 'Richie Whitecomb':10, 'Ben Ackerman':13, 'Aiden Elliff':15, 'Nick Orellana':17, 'Nathanial Fabricatore':18, 'Colin Sasser':21, 'Joe Marotta':24, 'Jan Salafia':27, 'Jack Mchale':28, 'Will Clegg':30, 'Sean Salafia':34, 'Robbie Donohue':25, 'Ethan Forrest':26}
#printed the dictionary, row
print(row)


#5. Imagine you were out for a day and someone else sat at your
#computer. How would you update the dictionary to reflect this
#change? Add this line after your print statement.


print('If I was out for a day and someone else sat at my computer, I would update the dictionary to reflect this change by calling the key within the dictionary and making += to the desired value to be updated, similar to thagt of lists.')
